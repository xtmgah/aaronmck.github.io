I’m helping to launch a new organization targeted at young cancer researchers (more to come in the future on this).  Like many young organizations, we’re trying to build up our web presence on the cheap, at least until the large grants role in (unlikely).  We’ve hobbled together a basic website, but it suffers from many, many design problems.  One of which is that it liberally uses black backgrounds.  This is something I really can’t stand in general, but I never really had much of a justification for my dislike.  I went surfing around the web, and found this great explanation for it:

The pure black we see on many sites simply isn’t natural, and it’s presence is really distracting.  Hopefully I can use this info to convince everyone we need to change out design.

It was finally meant to be as we got good weather and great conditions, and we got to the top of Rainier.
We took the DC route, which was amazingly well maintained and in perfect shape (late June is a great choice).  
Having tried the mountain twice before, I definitely benefited  from the learning process (e.g. previous mistakes).  
The standard gear list applies, which you can find on almost any site like [IMG's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wuqS3V2umY)
or [in list form](http://www.mountainguides.com/rainier-gear.shtml).  My biggest changes this time were to:

* Really focus on packing light.  For instance no midrange gloves, just light running gloves and burly mits.  No change of anything but socks.  Never boil water,
use [chlorine dioxide instead](http://www.aquamira.com/consumer/aquamira-water-treatment-drops/product-technology).  Nothing nice like camp booties (I know, I know).
* Getting a prescription for [Acetazolamide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetazolamide).  My first time up the mountain I felt really crappy from altitude 
and couldn't sleep, and this helped a ton this time.  Don't underrate a good five/six hours of sleep before a summit try.
* Sock liners.  These make pounding out the miles way, way more confortable, and helped keep my feet in good shape.  Would never do it again without them

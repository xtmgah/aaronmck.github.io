This floated by on my favorite time-waster, Reddit. Although it’s obviously aimed at fictional story writers, the best scientific writing also (tries) to tell a cohesive and compelling story. Looking through the list, many of the character points don’t apply, but overall many ideas could be considered in terms of scientific writing.  Simple messages set you free. Finish your story and move on, do better next time. Come up with your ending first, and work backwards. All of these points apply as aptly to science as they do to fiction, and I would be much further ahead taking these points to heart.

For me the most important point though is that it’s all about finishing the story and moving on; it’ll never be perfect, and the community will have moved on by the time you think it is.  Get something solid out there, get feedback, and improve what you deliver the next time around.  Science is full of papers sitting on shelves that will be finished “soon”…

I'm a graduate student in the [Shendure Lab](http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/), in the Genome Sciences department at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/).  Previously I was a engineer and computational biologist at the [Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT](http://www.broadinstitute.org) in [Gaddy Getz's cancer analysis group](http://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/gad-getz), [Mark DePristo's genome analysis group](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/), and [David Jaffe's genome assembly group](http://www.broadinstitute.org/genome_bio/bios/bio-jaffe.html).

You can see my academic publications on either my [Google scholar page](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALmdx44AAAAJ&hl=en) or on [Pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=aaron+mckenna).  You can see my code on [github](http://github.com/aaronmck) as well.
